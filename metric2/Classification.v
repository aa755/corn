** Classification of metric spaces
There is a heirarchy of properties that a metric space can possess.
At the lowest level a metric space is stable if its ball relation is
double negation stable.  Arguablely this could be made a requirement
of metric spaces. *)
Definition stableMetric (ms:MetricSpace) :=
 forall e (x y:ms), ~~(ball e x y) -> ball e x y.

Lemma stableEq : forall (ms:MetricSpace) (stable:stableMetric ms) (x y:ms),
 ~~(st_eq x y) -> st_eq x y.
Proof.
 intros ms stable x y Hxy.
 apply ball_eq.
 intros e.

(** At the next level up a metric space is located if you can choose
between ball d x y and ~ball e x y for e < d.  Every located metric
is a stable metric. *)
Definition locatedMetric (ms:MetricSpace) :=
 forall (e d:Qpos) (x y:ms), e < d -> {ball d x y}+{~ball e x y}.

(** At the top level a metric space is decidable if its ball relation
is decidable.  Every decidable metric is a located metric. *)
Definition decidableMetric (ms:MetricSpace) :=
 forall e (x y:ms), {ball e x y}+{~ball e x y}.
